> Vulcan Validator, validate data forms in client and server sides.

**Currently working in this project. Feel free to test it.**

A package to validate data objects (possibly extracted from HTML forms) in client and server sides and a customizable jQuery plugin to validate them in realtime.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save vulcanval
```

## Features

- Define universal validation configuration to validate in client and server sides in a really similar way.
- Use of the [validator.js](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js) package validators so we implement well tested string validators.
- Customizable interface.
- Highly configurable.
- Dynamic validation process.
- Ability to add custom validators functions.
- Ability to add custom fields different from form elements.
- Extract data from forms elements as data maps.
- Internationalization support.
- HTML5 integration.
- API to integrate with your own libraries.
- And more.

## Additionals

- You can add certain support to browser input autofill with this package [github.com/tbosch/autofill-event](https://github.com/tbosch/autofill-event).

## Thanks

To [Chris O'Hara](https://github.com/chriso) and everyone who contributed to [validator.js](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js) which this project relies on for raw validations.
