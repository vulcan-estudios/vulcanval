> Vulcan Validator.

A package to validate data objects (possibly extracted from HTML forms) in client and server sides and a customizable jQuery plugin to validate them in realtime.

You can add certain support to browser input autofill with this package [github.com/tbosch/autofill-event](https://github.com/tbosch/autofill-event).

## Thanks

To [Chris O'Hara](https://github.com/chriso) and everyone who contributed to [validator.js](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js) which this project relies on for raw validations.
